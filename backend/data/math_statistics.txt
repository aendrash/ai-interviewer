Probability: Study of random events, quantifying the likelihood of outcomes.
Random Variable: A variable representing a numerical outcome of a probabilistic event.
Mean: The average value in a dataset.
Median: The middle value when data points are arranged in order.
Mode: The value that occurs most frequently in a dataset.
Variance: Measure of how data points spread around the mean.
Standard Deviation: The square root of variance, indicating spread of data.
Covariance: How two variables change together.
Correlation: Standardized measure of how two variables move in relation to each other.
Linear Algebra: Study of vectors, matrices, and linear transformations; foundation of many ML algorithms.
Matrix Multiplication: Combining matrices in a way that preserves linear relationships.
Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues: Indicate direction and magnitude of important features in transforms.
Dot Product: Scalar result from multiplying and summing entries of two vectors, core to many ML computations.
Calculus: Study of change, including derivatives and integrals; used to optimize model parameters.
Gradient: The vector of partial derivatives, telling direction of steepest ascent/descent.
Optimization: Process of finding the best solution (e.g., minimum error) for a problem.
Cost Function: Mathematical function quantifying error to be minimized during training.
Maximum Likelihood Estimation: Method of estimating parameters that maximize observed data likelihood.
Statistical Inference: Drawing conclusions about populations from sample data.
Bayes’ Theorem: Describes how to update probabilities based on new evidence.
Hypothesis Testing: Determining if a result is statistically significant or due to chance.
p-value: Probability of observing data as extreme as what was observed, assuming null hypothesis is true.
Confidence Interval: Range of values likely to contain the true parameter with a specified probability.
Central Limit Theorem: States that sample means approach a normal distribution as the sample size grows.
Sample vs. Population: A sample is a subset of data; the population is the entire group of interest.
